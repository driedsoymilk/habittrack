1. This project is a habit tracker which allows users to add habits that they want to work on while tracking their progress over weeks/days.
2. I chose to include a collapsible habit card adder as well as many different progress bars. This includes the 2 bars at the top that show a daily heat map for daily habits and a weekly progression score for weekly habits.
3. this project took about 4 hours to develop from scratch.
